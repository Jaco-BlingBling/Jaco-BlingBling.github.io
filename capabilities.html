								<b>Creating with ICT:</b><br />
								Since a very young age, I have been curious about the world of ICT and almost all of the areas that it involves.
								I have taught myself to program and have created various video games, and apps since the age of 11, with one of these
								apps being: 'Experience' - The App.  Alongside programming and game development, I have learned about all sorts of
								other areas including: Photoshop, Video Editing, Music Production, 3D Modelling, and Animation. All of these skill
								are required to create a full fledged game by yourself, which was my dream for a long time as a kid. During the first
								semester of 2016, I made a website to help showcase the innovative product that was made corresponding with a few
								assignments done in CnC. The website mainly showcased the process of what the product is, how it was made and what
								it was made out of alongside with the advertising to help persuade the audience. During the website process, I learned
								how to use the online website maker WordPress to add text and images.<br />

									<b>Communicating with ICT:</b><br />
										Whilst being actively involved with the making of  'Experience' - The App, I had to have some form of quick response communication
								 		to my team in out of school hours as there was no way that we could have finished the app within school times only. We made use of
								 		Slack team conduct all of our online communication, helping us to collaborate effectively by being able to ask questions and get help,
								 		share ideas and what we have been working on at any time in the development of the game, and to plan and organise meetings and checkpoints
								 		that needed to be reached and updating them accordingly as to be kept in a realistic timeframe. This was a major advantage because it was
								 		hard to get everyone to be together at one time due to different year levels, ie. the year 12s often had commitments or tests that they had
								 		to do inside of school hours. The only disadvantage to this is that most of the communications were restricted to text, and I found it
								  	difficult to explain certain concepts and ideas through typing over the internet. For a solution to this, we ended up setting regular
										meetings that we would all attend as it got even harder to communicate in person after the year 12s in our team had finished high school.<br />
										<br />
									<b>Managing and Operating with ICT:</b><br />
										Early in 2018, I created a Discord bot, which when added to a users server, it will respond to various commands the user
										types in the text channel for entertainment purposes. From the beginning, I have had to manage this discord bot so there
										were no bugs, but also because new features have been added over time. To operate this bot, I've been managing my own VPS
										(virtual private server), where I update the bot's code from my main computer to the cloud on the VPS and it then updates
										in the Discord app to allow for new features and big fixes to become live.<br />
										<br />
									<b>Investigating with ICT:</b><br />
										On multiple occasions I've made use of various technological devices to research and find out various and sometimes opposing information for
										multiple assignments. A few examples of this is from my Research Project, where I used ICT to investigate speech recognition and the audio
										spectrum. Almost all of the information I retreived came from some form of the ICT with access to the internet. Another example is from my
										medical engineering topic in Year 11 where I designed a whale that speaks to you when it detects that you are feeling down.<br />
										<br />
									<b>Applying social and ethical protocols and practises when using ICT:</b><br />
										Apart of applying social and ethical protocols and practices whilst using ICT is being able to understand, accept, and follow the terms and conditions
										of various websites. Recently, there was a new regulation put into affect as of May 25th, basically stating that people have a right to access all of the
										information gathered by any particular company, that they will be notified of any potential breach of their personal data, as well as the companies
										needing to provide an intelligible and easily accessed form using clear and plain language. This is so the consumer will be able to read and understand
										the terms and conditions that they are agreeing too. I have been able to complete this part fo the ICT capability by reading through, agreeing to, and
										following the terms and conditions of every website I have signed up for using ICT. For my Research Project I conducted a survey, which helped me to gain
										 a generalised opinion on certain ideas and ways I was going about designing the game I succeeded in doing. During the process of making the survey, I
										 thought about ways I could overcome some ethical circumstances that when not met, could make certain people not want to participate in the research. I
										 overcame this by stating at the beginning that there would be privacy protection and anonymity if I were to speak about the results obtained. Part of
										 this was to also make sure that no one else was involved in looking at the individual data I retrieved other than myself. For my UES topic in semester
										 1 of 2018, I wrote a piece about RFID (radio-frequency identification) and its impacts in various workplaces and the general society as well as how it
										 could potentially impact our future; being a major role in ICT nowadays, I believe I chose my topic well.<br />

								<h2>Critical & Creative Thinking</h2>

							<p align="left">
								<b>Inquiring, identifying, exploring and organising information and ideas:</b><br />
								My Research Project heavily revolves around inquiring, identifying, exploring, and organising information and ideas. I was able to pose a
								 question, and multiple sub-questions to get to the overall answer to the main question whilst also organising and processing all of the
								 information I obtained during this process. This capability is also used for any out of school project I work on as I need to identify
								 and inquire about the topic I want to work on initially. I then explore, organise, and process information I have obtained, and use the
								 knowledge gained to be able to make something, ie. a game with a certain feature like AR (augmented reality). Here is a link to my folio,
								 showing evidence of information I have gathered along with answering the question and other sub-questions that arose after formulating the
								 initial question. <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJC1pl38OJw5DsBVxoXP86N6ulnkt4PH80_2VNrPMA0/edit?usp=sharing'>Link to Folio</a> <br/>
								 <br/>
								<b>Generating ideas, possibilities and actions:</b><br />
								My Research Project again was an example of how I was able to successfully generate idea, possibilities and actions, as my process was well
								documented in what I did correct, as well as what didn’t work out so well. This capability also applies to any project I’ve worked/will work
								 on as it involves being able look at a range of possibilities to a problem and then being able to connect what I’ve done solve any problem
								  at hand. If a solution that I have tried hasn’t worked, then I am able to move on and try to work out another way to solve the problem at hand.</br>
									<br/>
								<b>Reflecting on thinking processes:</b><br />
								I was able to show this part of the capability throughout my Research Project Folio as there was an entire page on my thought process and how I
								initially came up with my question as well as a page on how I planned out my time. At the bottom of each page there was also a red box, which
								had a reflection as well as links to critical and creative thinking capability and how I had progressed in achieving it from completing the each page.</br>
								<br/>
								<b>Analysing, synthesising and evaluating reasoning and procedures:</b><br />
								My Research Project Folio shows evidence of how I’ve applied logic and reasoning as to refine my approaches to the question at hand. With my Research
								Project Outcome drawing a clear and coherent conclusion from all of the problems faced along the way and showing exactly how I was able to get to the
								conclusion. Another example was the design prac I did in Physics in semester 1 of 2018. This allowed me to design an experiment, evaluate reasoning for
								my design and procedures of the experiment, and synthesize a well structured practical report based on the experiment.</br>

								<b>Social management:</b><br />
								I was able to work on and achieve my social management capability over the course of the 2 leadership camps I attended at the end of 2016 & 2017.
								There were various workshops about effective communication, collaboration, decision-making, negotiation, and leadership skills. I took notes on
								all of these workshops and I believe it helped me to progress and achieve this capability. I know this is the case because I used to be a TA
								(Teacher’s Assistant) at CodeCamp, where I work and I was able to show that I am confident, show good communication skills, am able to negotiate
								effectively with the children of my class, and show leadership in my class as to keep them on task, entertained, and well-behaved with and without a TA.<br/>

								<b>Estimating and calculating with whole numbers</b><br />
								In my Physics oral presentation I showed multiple ways of estimating and calculating values in context to the situation
								and giving examples of what the numbers represent involving days of travel, and fuel efficiency among other topics and problems.
								<a href='https://youtu.be/ijhLEIxRyQo'>Link to Physics Oral Presentation</a></br>
							</br>
								<b>Recognising and using patterns and relationships</b><br />
								The Maths Methods folio that I did in semester 1 of 2018 involved recognising and using patterns and relationships as a
								part of the rubric it was graded against. There was a pattern found and a conjecture made based on the pattern found in
								that part of the folio. This was then tested and proven that the conjecture was correct.<br />
								<br/>
								<b>Using fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios and rates</b><br />
								<br />
								<b>Using spatial reasoning:</b><br />
								Spatial reasoning was used almost all of the time when working on ‘Experience’ - the app, as
								the app was a 3D game. Various considerations had to be made to assure the game didn’t use up
								very much storage on the devices it would be developed for. This was done by scaling many 3D objects
								 down to allow for a smaller storage size when compressed and compiled into an application. As well as
								 this, 3D objects were created and manipulated as to attain the correct styles that were visualised to be
								 within the game.<br />
								 <br />
								 <b>Interpreting statistical information:</b><br />
								 I was able to interpret statistical information in my normal distributions SAT. I was able to achieve this in my binomial
								 distributions SAT and my Maths Methods oral presentation, which I also did on binomial statistics. In my binomial SAT I
								 obtained my own set of data and the entirety of the SAT involved interpreting the data obtained and evaluating whether or
								 not the data obtained was sufficient enough to show a good understanding of the topic and if it was reasonable in the context
								 given. Maths ‘Going Viral’ Folio for BiQ in early 2017 as I had to interpret data given and make graphs and analyse them.
								 The folio was based on some statistics given on the health of populations of people in different places in South Australia,
								 this data was given along with the effects of the population after a dosage of the antidote for a specific virus. A solution
								 was given to the problem about the virus outbreak by using and analysing the data given to find a reasonable result. <br />
