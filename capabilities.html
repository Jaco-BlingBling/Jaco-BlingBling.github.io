								<b>Creating with ICT:</b><br />
								Since a very young age, I have been curious about the world of ICT and almost all of the areas that it involves.
								I have taught myself to program and have created various video games, and apps since the age of 11, with one of these apps being:
								'Experience' - The App.  Alongside programming and game development, I have learned about all sorts of other areas including:
								Photoshop, Video Editing, Music Production, 3D Modelling, and Animation. All of these skill are required to create a full fledged
								game by yourself, which was my dream for a long time as a kid.
								During the first semester of 2016, I made a website to help showcase the innovative product that was made corresponding
								with a few assignments done in CnC. The website mainly showcased the process of what the product is, how it was made and
								 what it was made out of alongside with the advertising to help persuade the audience. During the website process, I learned
								  how to use the online website maker WordPress to add text and images. <br />

									<b>Communicating with ICT:</b><br />
										Whilst being actively involved with the making of  'Experience' - The App, I had to have some form of quick response communication
								 		to my team in out of school hours as there was no way that we could have finished the app within school times only. We made use of
								 		Slack team conduct all of our online communication, helping us to collaborate effectively by being able to ask questions and get help,
								 		share ideas and what we have been working on at any time in the development of the game, and to plan and organise meetings and checkpoints
								 		that needed to be reached and updating them accordingly as to be kept in a realistic timeframe. This was a major advantage because it was
								 		hard to get everyone to be together at one time due to different year levels, ie. the year 12s often had commitments or tests that they had
								 		to do inside of school hours. The only disadvantage to this is that most of the communications were restricted to text, and I found it
								  	difficult to explain certain concepts and ideas through typing over the internet. For a solution to this, we ended up setting regular
										meetings that we would all attend as it got even harder to communicate in person after the year 12s in our team had finished high school.<br />
										<br />
									<b>Managing and Operating with ICT:</b><br />
										Early in 2018, I created a Discord bot, which when added to a users server, it will respond to various commands the user
										types in the text channel for entertainment purposes. From the beginning, I have had to manage this discord bot so there
										were no bugs, but also because new features have been added over time. To operate this bot, I've been managing my own VPS
										(virtual private server), where I update the bot's code from my main computer to the cloud on the VPS and it then updates
										in the Discord app to allow for new features and big fixes to become live.<br />
										<br />
									<b>Investigating with ICT:</b><br />
										On multiple occasions I've made use of various technological devices to research and find out various and sometimes opposing information for
										multiple assignments. A few examples of this is from my Research Project, where I used ICT to investigate speech recognition and the audio
										spectrum. Almost all of the information I retreived came from some form of the ICT with access to the internet. Another example is from my medical
										engineering topic in Year 11 where I designed a whale.<br />

							<p align="left"><b>Using spatial reasoning:</b><br />
								Spatial reasoning was used almost all of the time when working on ‘Experience’ - the app, as
								the app was a 3D game. Various considerations had to be made to assure the game didn’t use up
								very much storage on the devices it would be developed for. This was done by scaling many 3D objects
								 down to allow for a smaller storage size when compressed and compiled into an application. As well as
								 this, 3D objects were created and manipulated as to attain the correct styles that were visualised to be
								 within the game.<br />
								 <br />
								 <b>Interpreting statistical information:</b><br />
								 Maths ‘Going Viral’ Folio for BiQ in early 2017 as I had to interpret data given and make graphs and analyse
								  them. The folio was based on some statistics given on the health of populations of people in different places
									in South Australia, this data was given along with the effects of the population after a dosage of the antidote
									for a specific virus. A solution was given to the problem about the virus outbreak by using and analysing the data
									given to find a reasonable result
